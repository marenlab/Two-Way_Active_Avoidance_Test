# **Two-Way Active Avoidance Test**

This function streamlines the visualization and organization of experimental data from the Colbourn active avoidance chamber by aligning the outputs with distinct event types recorded throughout the session.
<br /> 
------------------
Script: **Avoidance_Analyse**<br /> 
Main Call<br /> 
– Analyze one or more *.csv files.<br /> 
– This script relies on the following function: Avoidance_conditioning.m<br /> 
<br /> 
Required Files<br /> 
– *.csv files generated by the Colbourn active avoidance chamber.<br /> 
<br /> 
------------------
Function: **Avoidance_conditioning**<br /> 
<br /> 
INPUT:<br /> 
input_settings – Settings for the experiment (e.g., thresholds, parameters).<br /> 
raw_data – The input dataset from a *.CSV file generated by the Colbourn active avoidance chamber. The spreadsheet consists of five columns:<br /> 
<br /> 
Arbitrary timestamps (no alignment with the time course of the experiment).<br /> 
Time in MM:SS:FFF format (minutes/seconds/milliseconds).<br /> 
Event labels: "Entry" and "Exit" corresponding to the start of periods during programmed stimuli.<br /> 
Numerical labels for the events described in column 5.<br /> 
Descriptive event labels including:<br /> 
  – "Acclimatation": Baseline period.<br /> 
  – "Right/Left Entrance": Animal enters the shuttle.<br /> 
  – "Right/Left Exit": Animal exits the shuttle.<br /> 
  – "Pav CS": Start of Pavlovian conditioning, followed by an "US".<br /> 
  – "CS": Conditioned stimulus.<br /> 
  – "ITI": Inter-trial interval.<br /> 
  – "CS Remainder": Reinforcing conditioned stimulus after a "CS".<br /> 
  – "after CS": Events occurring after the CS Remainder (renamed to "Silence gap after CS remainder").<br /> 
<br /> 
OUTPUT:<br /> 
Summary – A summary of all shuttle events during the experimental session.<br /> 
Intervals – Time intervals corresponding to each CS, CS remainder, after-CS, ITI, and US.<br /> 
Output_Events – Annotated events for each phase, organized in a cell array:<br /> 
  • Column 1: Acclimation phase.<br /> 
  • Column 2: Pavlovian CS phase.<br /> 
  • Column 3: CS, US, and ITI periods.<br /> 
<br /> 
For Output_Events{X}, each spreadsheet consists of:<br /> 
– Column 1: Time course of the experiment.<br /> 
– Column 2: Shuttle direction.<br /> 
– Column 3: Phase during which the shuttle occurred.<br /> 
– Column 4: Description of the phase.<br /> 
– Column 5: Delta t (time difference) from the previous event to the shuttle event.<br /> 
– Column 6: Description of the event that preceded the shuttle event.<br /> 
<br /> 
------------------
Script:** Avoidance_stats**<br /> 
<br /> 
INPUT:<br /> 
The input dataset comes from the Summary output, which includes all total shuttles from the experimental phase for all animals.<br /> 
<br /> 
OUTPUT:<br /> 
Stats.summary → A 1x3 cell array, where:<br /> 
– Column 1 → Acclimation phase<br /> 
– Column 2 → Pavlovian CS phase<br /> 
– Column 3 → CS, US, and ITI periods of the avoidance session<br /> 
<br /> 
Within each cell, each column corresponds to one animal for the respective event.<br /> 
The order of animals follows the structure of the original upload folder and can be verified using: header.Filename_csv<br /> 
<br /> 
The output also includes a *.csv file containing all data, with each experimental phase separated by blank lines.
